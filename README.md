## Readme

This is the project for Data Mining Lesson created by Mahmut Akyol!

### Database

I used prepeared DB from [UCI](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Early+stage+diabetes+risk+prediction+dataset.) diabet database;


### Frontend

I am usigin VueJS in frontend. In order to run frontend application, I suggest that you should instlal VueJS CLI.

```bash
$ yarn global add @vue/cli
$ vue --version
```

> Detailed documentation is in [here](https://cli.vuejs.org/guide/installation.html)

To run frontend application, you should execute serve command in `app` directory. 

```bash
$ yarn
$ yarn run serve
```

After that command, you may see the application on [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)

> Whenever you change a file in `app/src`, vue cli applies it on browser automatically. You don't have to execute again `yarn run serve` command or even refresh the browser.
